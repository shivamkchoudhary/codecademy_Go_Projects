# Gopher It


An effective way to learn something new is by making something! In this project weâ€™re going to incorporate the use of fmt to make [ASCII art](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ASCII_art). One suggestion is to make a gopher:





      `.-::::::-.`
  .:-::::::::::::::-:.
  `_:::    ::    :::_`
   .:( ^   :: ^   ):.
   `:::   (..)   :::.
   `:::::::UU:::::::`
   .::::::::::::::::.
   O::::::::::::::::O
   -::::::::::::::::-
   `::::::::::::::::`
    .::::::::::::::.
      oO:::::::Oo
      
      
      
      
But feel free to make what you want. In other words, gopher it.
